These are the files that make up undergrad research project this summer. These files were borrowed from my lab partner (Who made them originally with the help of ChatGPT). I modified them afterwards (also with ChatGPT). This code calls an API to get weather data for a certain time period at a certain coordinate using Visual Crossing's API. Then, that data is pre-processed and fed to an LSTM model that tries to predict future wind speeds and solar radiation amounts at that location. The dashboard allows the user to select the location and invoke the model and the API to get their desired predictions. This project, while finished, still has some issues that I wasn't able to iron out. Like overfitting. Overall, this is in part to assist my research project, whose goal is to be able to create a tool that allows for visualization and analysis of hybrid/renewable EV charging stations (such stations would not be powered solely with natural gas. Some load would be offset with renewable energy. Hence the need for such a tool).
